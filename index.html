        <h2>Accessibility Testing</h2>
        <p>Accessibility testing ensures that software applications are usable by people with disabilities. This includes testing for compatibility with screen readers, ensuring proper color contrast for the visually impaired, and keyboard navigation for users who cannot use a mouse. By making software accessible, we can ensure that it is inclusive and can be used by everyone, regardless of their abilities.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Screen Reader Compatibility:</strong> Testing with various screen readers to ensure all content is accessible. This involves checking for proper semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, and ensuring that interactive elements are properly labeled.</li>
            <li><strong>Color Contrast Testing:</strong> Ensuring text and background colors have sufficient contrast to be readable by users with visual impairments. Tools like contrast checkers can help verify that the color combinations meet accessibility standards.</li>
            <li><strong>Keyboard Navigation:</strong> Making sure that all interactive elements can be accessed and operated using a keyboard. This includes testing tab order, focus indicators, and ensuring that no functionality requires a mouse.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessible Forms:</strong> Verifying that forms are labeled correctly and usable with assistive technologies. This involves checking that form fields are associated with their labels, error messages are accessible, and that forms can be submitted without a mouse.</li>
            <li><strong>ARIA Roles and Landmarks:</strong> Using ARIA roles to improve the navigation and structure for screen readers. This includes applying roles to sections of the page, using landmarks for navigation, and ensuring that dynamic content updates are communicated to assistive technologies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Implementing these accessibility practices not only ensures compliance with legal standards but also enhances the overall user experience for a diverse audience.</p>

    <section id="functional">
        <h2>Functional Testing</h2>
        <p>Functional testing verifies that the software performs its intended functions correctly. It focuses on user interactions and the overall functionality of the application, ensuring that all features work as expected. This type of testing is crucial to identify and fix any issues before the software is released to the users.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Unit Testing:</strong> Testing individual components to ensure they function correctly in isolation. This is typically done by developers using automated tests that validate the behavior of specific functions or methods.</li>
            <li><strong>Integration Testing:</strong> Testing the interaction between integrated components to identify any interface defects. This ensures that different modules or services within the application work together as intended.</li>
            <li><strong>System Testing:</strong> Verifying that the complete system works as intended and meets the specified requirements. This type of testing is often done by QA teams and involves end-to-end testing of the entire application.</li>
            <li><strong>Acceptance Testing:</strong> Ensuring the software meets business requirements and is ready for production use. This is typically the final phase of testing, where the software is evaluated by the end-users or clients to ensure it meets their needs and expectations.</li>
            <li><strong>Regression Testing:</strong> Re-running tests after changes to ensure that existing functionalities are not affected. This is crucial for maintaining software quality as it evolves and new features are added.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By thoroughly conducting functional testing, organizations can reduce the risk of defects, improve software quality, and enhance user satisfaction.</p>
    </section>
    <section id="ui">
        <h2>UI Testing</h2>
        <p>UI testing involves verifying that the user interface of an application meets the required specifications. It ensures that the visual elements are functioning correctly and provides a positive user experience. This type of testing is essential to make sure that the application is user-friendly and accessible.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Layout Verification:</strong> Checking that the layout is consistent across different devices and screen sizes. This includes ensuring that elements are properly aligned, there are no overlapping items, and that the layout adapts to different resolutions.</li>
            <li><strong>Usability Testing:</strong> Assessing how easy and intuitive the application is to use from the user's perspective. This often involves gathering feedback from real users to identify any usability issues and areas for improvement.</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-browser Testing:</strong> Ensuring the application works correctly across different web browsers. This involves testing the application in various browsers to identify and fix any compatibility issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Responsive Design Testing:</strong> Verifying that the application is responsive and adapts to various screen resolutions. This includes testing on different devices, such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones, to ensure a consistent user experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Visual Consistency:</strong> Making sure that the visual elements are consistent with the design specifications. This involves checking that fonts, colors, buttons, and other UI elements match the design guidelines and provide a cohesive look and feel.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>UI testing helps in identifying visual defects, improving the overall design, and ensuring that the application provides a seamless and engaging experience for the users.</p>
